=Tutorial: Create a secure request/response service using HTTPS with mutual authentication=

*Content*
<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

=Introduction=

*Prerequisites* for this tutorial is that the [InstallationGuide installation guide] is completed, including installing soapUI.

This tutorial will help you get started with creating a [ConceptsAndDefinitions#Request/Response Request/Response service] that is secured by using HTTPS with mutual authentication. Initial setup of HTTPS with mutual authentication can be quit challenging getting all the security pieces in the right places. Typically nothing works until all security pieces are configured correctly making it even more challenging. Getting a fully working skeleton code generated for you service (including test-consumer, test-producer and integration test can therefore be a great time saver!

Before we jump into the tutorial we will briefly go through:

 # HTTPS with mutual authentication
 # The functionality in the generated service
 # The code that is generated

== Briefly about HTTPS with mutual authentication ==
 
HTTPS with mutual authentication refers to a client authenticating themselves to a server and that server authenticating itself to the user in such a way that both parties are assured of the others identity using HTTPS, i.e. HTTP on top of the SSL/TLS protocol. Certificates of trusted parties are kept in a trust store and validated against during the initial handshaking.

The initial handshaking is summarized by the following picture:

For more details see fro example [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer#Client-authenticated_TLS_handshake Client-authenticated TLS handshake]

== Briefly about the service  ==

For this tutorial we will create a service that act as a SOAP proxy between a service consumer and a service producer using HTTPS with mutual authentication to secure the communication.

http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/0-EP-SecureRequestResponse.png

The service will do the following:

 # receives SOAP/HTTPS requests from service consumers 
 # process the request e.g. transform it and create log records regarding the processing
 # invokes a service producer using SOAP/HTTPS, optionally using various kinds of routing
 # waits for the response from the producer, given a configurable timeout period
 # process the response (including errors) e.g. transform it and create log records regarding the processing
 # send back the response to the consumer

== Briefly about the code generated == 

The soi-toolkit generator helps you get started by generating skeleton source code files for a new service illustrated by the following picture:

http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/RequestResponseService/RequestResponse-SourceFiles.png

*Color schema:* yellow for files that build up the actual service, green for test-classes and gray for classes used by the test-classes.

In summary the generated files are:

 * A Mule service with:
  * Transformers for both the request and the response.
  * Proper error handling, both for error messages from the producer and capturing technical errors, such as timeouts.
  * Tracing, by default log-events are created when both a request and a response are received and when they are sent.  

 * jUnit based unit-tests for the transformers

 * jUnit based integration-tests for the Mule service
  * Including a test-consumer and a teststub for the producer.
  * Generated integration tests cover both a "happy days" scenario and negative tests (invalid input + timeout tests)

 * Configurable properties for settings that needs to be environment specific
  * E.g. for endpoint adresses, timeouts and certificate information. 
  * The property files can be encrypted to secure sensitive information, e.g. regarding certificates, see [http://code.google.com/p/soi-toolkit/wiki/UG_PropertyFile property file configuration and usage] for more information

=Tutorial=

The tutorial is divided in the following tasks:

 # Create a new integration component
 # Create skeleton code for the service
 # Test the service automatically
  * Run generated unit and integrations tests
 # Test the service manually
  * Start Mule ESB with the service and a teststub service for the producer
  * Call the service using the generated CXF consumer
  * Call the service using soapUI
  * Stop the server

==Create a new integration component==

First we need to create an [ConceptsAndDefinitions#Core_Concepts integration component], i.e. a Maven project for a number of related services and integrations. The Maven project is automatically imported into Mule Studio and creates a Mule App (zip-file) when its package goal is executed so it very easy to create a deployable artifact from an integration component.

Perform the following steps in Mule Studio:

 * Select the menu "File --> New --> Other" and expand the wizard "SOI Toolkit Code Generator"
 * Select the code generator "Create a new SOI Toolkit component"

 http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/1.1_createIc.png

 * Click on the "Next >" button
 The wizard "SOI Toolkit - Create a new Component" opens up
  * Select the component type "Integration Component" in the radio button control named "Type of component"
  * Specify a proper name of the component in the field "Artifact Id"
  * Specify a proper group name in the field "Group Id"
  * Select where you want the files to be created in the field "Root folder"
 
 Note: The pre-selected root folder is picked up from the preference page you filled in during the installation of the soi-toolkit plugin.

 http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/1.2_createIc.png

 * Click on the "Next >" button
 The wizard now displays a new page where you can perform some initial configuration of the new integration component
  * In the drop down box called "Mule version" you can select what version of Mule you want the integration component to use.
     Only v3.3.0 is available for soi-toolkit v0.6.0.
  * Deselect all transports except JMS, that is used for logging, since we will not need them for this tutorial

 http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/1.3_createIc.png

 * Click on the "Finish" button

 The wizard now starts to execute and logs its output to a text area.

 http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/1.4_createIc.png

 * The following work is performed by the wizard:
  * Created folders and files according to the input on the previous page.
  * Launch maven to do a initial build and also create eclipse files
  * Imports the project into the current Mule Studio workspace

==Create skeleton code for the service==

We are now creating the skeleton code for the service:

 * Select the menu "File --> New --> Other" and expand the wizard "SOI Toolkit Code Generator"
 * Select the code generator "Create a new service"

 http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/2.1_createService.png

 * Click on the "Next >" button
 * The wizard "SOI Toolkit - Create a new service" opens up
  * Select the message exchange pattern "Request/Response"
  * Select the inbound transport "SOAP/HTTPS"
  * Select the outbound transport "SOAP/HTTPS"
  * Select your service project using the "Browse..." button
  * Set a proper service-name
  HINT: Avoid using "{{{service}}}" in the name of the service since the actual Mule service will be suffixed with "{{{-service}}}"

 http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/2.2_createService.png

 * Click on the "Finish" button
  * The wizard now starts to generate files and refresh the workspace.

 * When the wizard is done you can find the files for your new service in the Mule Studio Package Explorer

 http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/2.3_createService.png

 The two most important files generated are the Mule flow configuration file, {{{mySample-service.xml}}}:

==Test the service automatically==

The integration tests are configured to only reply on embedded resource managers, e.g. messaging, ftp, sftp and/or database servers. This means that Mule will startup these servers inside the JVM during startup of the integration tests reducing the need of pre configured and started resource managers.

All generated tests are based on jUnit and will run when Maven executes it test goal. The tests can also be started by hand within Mule Studio using the default Eclipse support for jUnit as described below. 

===Run generated unit and integrations tests===

 * Run unit tests
  * Right-click the project {{{sample1}}} and select "Run As" --> "JUnit Test"
  Both integration and unit tests are executed and its success are reported in the JUnit view.
  The Console view displays at the same time log-messages from the execution:

 http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/5_jUnitTestResults.png

  NOTE: Take a look at the unit test code and the transformer code for a better understanding on what is going on :-)

==Test the service manually==

Writing automated integration tests are a strongly recommended behavior but from time to time it is also valuable to be able to start Mule with services and teststub producer services defined in the integration component directly from within Mule Studio and do some manual tests.

===Start Mule ESB with the service and a teststub service for the producer===

When doing manual tests we normally want to do it agains external pre-started resource managers, such as an external messaging server.
Since the generated code depends on a Apache ActiveMQ server for sending log-messages you either has to install and start ActiveMQ in your development environment or change the configuration to use an embedded ActiveMQ server. See [http://code.google.com/p/soi-toolkit/wiki/IG_RT_ActiveMQ install ActiveMQ] for instructions or simply change the jms connector in the file {{{src/main/app/sample1-common.xml}}} from:

{{{
soitoolkit-mule-jms-connector-activemq-external.xml
}}}

to:

{{{
soitoolkit-mule-jms-connector-activemq-embedded.xml
}}}

as visualized in the following screenshot:
http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/6.1_manualTest.png	

Start Mule ESB with the service and its teststub service for the producer by right-click on {{{src/test/java/org/sample/sample1/Sample1MuleServer.java}}} and select "Run As" --> "Java Application".

The following should be written to the console after a few seconds:

http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/6.3_manualTest.png

*NOTE:* Currently we can't use the standard Mule Application launcher that comes with Mule Studio since it doesn't work with mule config files outside the {{{src/main/app}}} folder meaning that teststubs for service producers from the {{{src/test/resources}}} folder currently can't be launched using the default Mule Studio launcher.

===Call the service using the generated CXF consumer===

http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/6.5_manualTest.png
http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/6.6_manualTest.png

===Call the service using soapUI===

 http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/7.1_soapui_sllSettings.png
 http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/SecureRequestResponseService/7.2_soapui_createProject.png

Note that the actual readable text in the output above are identities of the certificates and from the not actual payload.

===Stop Mule ESB===
