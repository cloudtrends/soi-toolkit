#summary Installation guide Java SE.

= Installation Guide for Java SE =

It it preferred to install the full JDK (Java Development Kit) over the smaller JRE (Java Runtime Environment) since the JDK contains a number of valuable debug tools such as JConsole (JMX console) and Java Visual VM (Java profiler).

==On Microsoft Windows==

Install Java SE according to the following instructions:

 * Download JDK for Java SE 6 from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.
 A file named similar to {{{jdk-6u37-windows-x64.exe}}} is downloaded to your server.

 * Execute the downloaded installation program and use default values for the installation of both the JDK and the JRE.

 * Create an environment variable, JAVA_HOME, in Windows that points to the installation directory. 
 E.g. {{{JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_37}}}

 * Add the bin-folder of the JDK to the Windows PATH-environment variable.
 E.g. {{{PATH=...;%JAVA_HOME%\bin}}}

 * Verify the installation in a command window with the commands {{{java –version}}},  {{{javac –version}}} och {{{set JAVA_HOME}}}. The result should be similar to:
