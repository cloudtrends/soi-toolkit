<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

=Introduction=

This tutorial will help you get started with creating an [ConceptsAndDefinitions#Definitions integration component] for [ConceptsAndDefinitions#Definitions test stub producers]. This type of integration components can come very handy in a test environment where not all service producers are ready for test. The test stub producers normally used in integration tests can be separately deployed in this type of integration component. For more information regarding this concept see [Architecture#Test_Driven_Development test driven development].


An integration component for test stub producers goes in pair with the original integration component that contains the actual code for the test stub producers. This means that an integration component for test stub producers doesn't contain any code of its own but instead have dependencies to the code in the original integration component.

*Prerequisites* for this tutorial is that the [TutorialCreateIntegrationComponent Create a new Integration Component] is completed. This tutorial assumes that you named the integration component "sample1".

=Create a new integration component for test stub producers=

First we need to create an [ConceptsAndDefinitions#Core_Concepts integration component], i.e. a Maven project for a number of related services and integrations. The Maven project is automatically imported into Mule Studio and creates a Mule App (zip-file) when its package goal is executed so it very easy to create a deployable artifact from an integration component.

Perform the following steps in Mule Studio:

 * Select the menu "File --> New --> Other" and expand the wizard "SOI Toolkit Code Generator"
 * Select the code generator "Create a new SOI Toolkit component"

 * Click on the "Next >" button
 The wizard "SOI Toolkit - Create a new Component" opens up
  * Select the component type "Integration Component" in the radio button control named "Type of component"
  * Specify a proper name of the component in the field "Artifact Id"
  * Specify a proper group name in the field "Group Id"
  * Select where you want the files to be created in the field "Root folder"
 
 Note: The pre-selected root folder is picked up from the preference page you filled in during the installation of the soi-toolkit plugin.

 * Click on the "Finish" button

 The wizard now starts to execute and logs its output to a text area.
        The wizard now starts to generate files and refresh the workspace.

    When the wizard is done you can find the files for your new component in the Mule Studio Package Explorer:

 * The following work is performed by the wizard:
  * Created folders and files according to the input on the previous page.
  * Launch maven to do a initial build and also create eclipse files
  * Imports the project into the current Mule Studio workspace
