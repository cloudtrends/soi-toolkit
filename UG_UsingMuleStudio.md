# Using Mule Studio with soi-toolkit #

**Content**


# Introduction #

Soi-toolkit generates source code according to a classic maven structure including maven pom.xml files.

Mule Studio projects are also based on a maven inspired file structure with som Mule Studio specific extensions and limitations.

Source code generated by soi-toolkit is therefore adopted to fit into the source code structures expected by Mule Studio as far as possible. In some cases Mule Studio however does not support all the concepts of soi-toolkit.

One example is Mule config files for Mule flows only used for test purposes. They shall be placed under the test-folder (i.e. not being a part of the release) but Mule Studio only support Mule config files that are placed under the main/app folder...

The soi-toolkit Eclipse plugin for the generators is fully compliant with Mule Studio and can installed and used in the same way as in any Eclipse environment, see [soi-toolkit Eclipse plugin](http://code.google.com/p/soi-toolkit/wiki/InstallationGuide#Soi-toolkit_Eclipse_plugin) for details.

However some issues exists using soi-toolkit and Mule Studio together and they are explained in this wiki-page:

  * Setup (including link)
    * M2\_REPO variable
    * Disable show errors (not fully support fpr spring et al in MS)

  * Test flows

  * flows in the test-classes folder

  * eclipse:eclipse must be used...
